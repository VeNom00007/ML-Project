13/12/22, 13:12 - Deepak CSE: *Open Elective Allotment*
Open Elective portal for submitting your preference order has been opened for BTech third-year students for the 3-2 semester.
You can start filling in your preferences.
1) Go to the "Open Elective" tab on your Student Portal dashboard.
2) Read through the instructions carefully.
3) Click on the green "Application" button on the top to enter your preference order.
4) As you select the subjects, the subject preference number will appear on the button. "1" for highest preference and so on.
5) You can "Reset" to remove the preference numbers. You can also re-order and "Submit" as many times as needed before the deadline.
6) After pressing "Submit", the subject list will re-order according to your choices. Check again at this point if all appears correct.
7) At this point, you can again select a different order and "Submit" if required.
Deadline: 11:59 pm, Tuesday December 20, 2022
NOTES:-
Everyone has 15 choices
-> Allocation of courses is completely based on CGPA and preference.
-> WSDC is transparent in the allocation of open electives. The entire allocation process is automated with a pre-defined algorithm, and thus no student has the right to allot or change the allotted elective.
-> Allotment results will be published a day later after the deadline.
-> Be careful while submitting. Submitting the wrong choices in a hurry is not considered as a valid problem. You may re-order as many times as you want before the allotment. 
*However, once the allotment has been done, we cannot change your elective without a letter from the Examination Department signed by Dean Academics.
-> If you fail to update your preferences before the deadline, the default preference order will be used for allotment.
-> Please note that the selections are made in the descending order of preference. i.e. "1" represents the highest preference, and "15" represents the lowest preference.
Please fill out your choices at the earliest. We have strict orders from the dean regarding the deadline, and hence, we won't be able to do anything if you were not able to update your preferences.

The faculty wants to conduct it for all three sections in common on this Friday in the Data Centre as we don't have any lab slots that can accommodate 170 students available for conducting exams.

Hence, we are trying to figure out a slot in our CSE labs on 27 or 28 March. 

If the lab slots are free, faculty have no objection in postponing.

We will go to the lab incharge tomorrow and try to figure out something.
Only then, i can give you an update on the postponement.

Until then, "DS lab is on Friday"...Prepare well.

After passing the proposals in BOG, a decision was taken regarding the hostel fee and the new structure will be uploaded in the website shortly. 

20% concession will be given to the final years ( double and single occupancy). 15% for the 3rd years and 10% for 2nd years. There will be cumulative increment of the percentage over the period of time till the present 2nd years pass out,(i.e second years will get 10% in 2nd year and 15% and 20% in their 3rd and 4th years respectively).

 First years and following years will not have changes in the fee structure.

This is decided hostel fee for now, the official structure will be uploaded in the website shortly. Any more changes will be informed. A different proposal including the caution deposit is made by us today, it'll be updated as soon as it is approved.

Internet Super Server-Getting Reports from Service Servers about clients:

 

Internet Super Server is different from inetd in logic.
After Internet Super Server accepts and execs a Service Sever, the Service Server has to send(report) the same data which it receives from client to the Super Server continuously.

Implement Internet Super Server Process, a sample Service Server Process and client

3-5 CN
21/04/23, 14:46 - Deepak CSE: Yesterday(20/04/2023), my white iPhone 13 was stolen from room number C-301 E&ICT building during computer networks minor-2 exam. A formal FIR has been lodged with the authorities, and we have also contacted Apple Service Center regarding the matter. They have assured us that the FindMyiPhone feature can track the phone, and the process will commence from 5 PM onwards.

Similar incident occurred in October, and even though the phone was tracked using FindMyiPhone, no actions were taken against the culprit, who was a student from the Chemical Department. However, this time, we are determined to take strict action against the student responsible and will file a police complaint. We will ensure that the student faces severe consequences and that the college administration takes appropriate measures.

If the person who has taken the phone would like to return it, they may do so by today. No further action will be taken in that case. However, if the phone is not returned by today, the police will investigate the matter, and legal action will be taken against the individual responsible for the theft. We urge the person who has taken the phone to return it as soon as possible and avoid any legal complications.

We hope that such incidents will not be repeated in the future, and students will realize the gravity of their actions.

Like:
DevOps  and _Software Engineering_ on Coursera, AWS _Cloud_ on Coursera.

17/07/23, 01:19 - Prashant Bairu CSE: Hey guys,
Since a few months I've switched to Microsoft services due to the constraints on Google services our institute has imposed.

You might have seen me sharing some docs and files using OneDrive and SharePoint. 

I've loved the flexibility and since a long time, I've been looking for an alternative solution for our official communications. 

WhatsApp is great but the purpose it was developed was for personal communications. 

It doesn't have enhancements for professional/academic use. 

For example, I wanted to organise announcements of every subject as a separate channel, but that would create a havoc in your WhatsApp chat list.

I've tried out Slack and I found that ideal but the features are restricted to some extent.

Being the tech savvy follks, we must lookout for a best fit solution for our problems. Right?!

How about MS Teams?

It is fully integrated with Office 365, you can share docs, files right from your OneDrive. 

And the best thing is OneDrive provides 1TB of storage for student emails.

I know it takes time to get used to it, but I'd say let's take up the initiative. 

I know you all are very much used to WhatsApp but I also know how many times you've felt cluttered due to mixing up of your personal chats and the academic communications.


Hence, are you up for the switch? 

I'll create a video to walk you through the features of MS Teams soon! But before that please let me know your comments. Any valid comment is highly valued. Please don't say that people will find it hard , people won't switch and all the mindset related stuff.
